practical between normal users ownership  changed by normal user :
A normal user in Linux cannot change the owner of a file they own, even if they are the current owner; only a root user (with elevated privileges) can use the chown command to modify file ownership. 
Key points about file ownership in Linux:
chown command:
This command is used to change the owner of a file, but it requires root privileges to modify the owner of any file.
User limitations:
While a normal user can view file permissions and change group ownership (within the groups they belong to), they cannot directly change the owner of a file.
